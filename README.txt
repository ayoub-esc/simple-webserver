When running webserver.py you must be in the directory that webserver.py is in. Otherwise the webserver will not be able to find HelloWorld.html. 
The server runs on port 6789, so the url to access the HelloWorld.html through the server would be http://localhost:6789/HelloWorld.html.
When using client.py the filename should not be preceeded by a /.
